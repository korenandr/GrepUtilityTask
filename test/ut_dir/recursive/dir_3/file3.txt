"I write to you - what more can be said?
What more can I add to that one fact?
For now, I know, it is in your power
To punish me contemptuously.
But you, keeping for my unhappy lot
At least a drop of pity,
You will not abandon me.
At first I wanted to be silent;
Believe me: my shame, my suffering,
You would never have known.
When hope had not a glimmer
And I was silent, I would have perished.
But I have no strength to subdue
My soul's desires and my heart's passion."

- Alexander Pushkin, Eugene Onegin

"Should this life sometime deceive you,
Don't be sad or mad at it!
On a gloomy day, submit:
Trust - fair day will come, why grieve you?
Heart lives in the future, so
What if gloom pervades the present?
All is fleeting, all will go;
What is gone will then be pleasant."

- Alexander Pushkin, If by Life You Were Deceived
